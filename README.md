### 🌟 What is this repository?
**Grokking Command Line** is a **curated collection** of:

- 🖥️ **Linux command‑line utilities** — the everyday tools every power user should know  
- 🔄 **Bash scripting demos** — practical scripts for loops, conditionals, arguments, and automation  
- 📊 **Structured data manipulation** — YAML with `jq` and `yq`  

---

### 🎯 Why it matters
This repository is designed as a **hands‑on learning playground** for anyone who wants to:

- 🏗️ **Master the command line** — build fluency with foundational commands  
- ⚙️ **Automate workflows in shell** — reduce repetitive tasks with scripts  
- 📑 **Manipulate structured data formats** — YAML & JSON for DevOps, Kubernetes, and beyond  

---

#### ✨ Highlights

- 🖥️ **Bash Scripting**: Learn loops, conditionals, arguments, variables, exit codes, and more through practical scripts.  
- ⚙️ **Core Linux Commands**: Explore essential tools for file operations, networking, process management, resource monitoring, scheduling, and text manipulation.  
- 📊 **Structured Data Utilities**: Work with YAML, JSON, and JSONPath using tools like `jq` and `yq`.  
- 🛠️ **Helper Scripts**: Utility scripts (like `tree.py`) to visualize and manage repository structures.
